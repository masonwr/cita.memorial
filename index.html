						Cita Olivia Riley passed on February 2nd peacefully in her home in Santa Fe, NM. She died from
						cancer. Her cancer moved like an avalanche, quick and devastatingâ€”leaving her and her loved ones
						in
						shock.
					</p>

					<p>
						Born in 1952 in Corpus Christi, Texas, the daughter of Olivia Gouger and Paul Warren Mason; Cita
						was
						the third of their three daughters. The family moved to Fort Worth, Texas, when she was in
						elementary school.
					</p>

					<p>
						Asking and seeking more of the world she left her hometown of Fort Worth, Texas, to explore
						living
						in Austin, New Orleans, Washington DC, Philadelphia, Salt Lake City, and ultimately Santa Fe.
					</p>

					<p>
						Cita built her home in Santa Fe and gave generously to the community. She worked as a yoga
						instructor (after studying in Pune, India), as the executive director of the Santa Fe Youth
						Symphony, and at the Santa Fe Waldorf School. After retiring, she continued to serve education,
						volunteering to support local libraries and acted as a reading and math tutor.
					</p>
					<p>
						Blessing those around her with a deeply generous spirit and the rare ability to see the world
						with
						lightness. Not a frivolous or shallow lightness either, but a thoughtful and caring lightness
						she
						nurtured throughout her life. The kind of lightness that helped others bear the weight of living
						-
						quick to laugh, fun, adventurous, loving, and deeply kind.
					</p>

						Cita is preceded in death by her father, mother, and sister Nancy Hall Mason Johnston. Surviving
						her are her children, Winston Riley and Hunter Riley, sister Carol Norris, housemate and friend
						Kate Nelson, and partner Jack Zwemer.
